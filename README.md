# SPGecco

This is a subject about the Subpolar Gyre in the North Atlantic and ECCO. it is specifically about the heat content. 

## Project Title and Introduction

Towards understanding the heat content in the subpolar gyre and its influences using EMU

The subpolar gyre is a crucial oceanic circulation system located in the high-latitude regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Characterized by a counterclockwise flow in the Northern Hemisphere, the subpolar gyre plays a significant role in regulating climate and marine ecosystems. It helps facilitate the exchange of heat and nutrients between polar and subtropical waters, contributing to the global thermohaline circulation. This gyre is particularly important for its influence on the distribution of sea ice, carbon sequestration, and nutrient cycling, which support a variety of marine species, from phytoplankton to large fish populations. 

In this one-week ECCO hackathon project, we put our effort into understanding the heat content in the subpolar gyre and its influences using the EMU tool that we have learned.

## Project Results

We calculated the heat budget of the SPG, and found that the Gyre is warming, but there is no accelerated warming. 

We made some connection between heat transport and ocean at various latitude. 

Using adjoint method, we were able to identify potentially interesting dynamical mechanisms that controls the heat transport into SPG along NAC.
